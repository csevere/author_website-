Before she dies, a fiery hand scoops her from her family and transports her 300 years in the future in a new body. Future Boston is a dark world where metal plates cover the skies and factions run the streets with ruthlessness. In her fight to survive her daily life and understand her startling transformation, Aly encounters a Curator of Life who reveals she is a Curator of Destruction who must stop elites living on the Moon from selling Earth to a hostile alien race. But too much power can make you selfish.</p>
